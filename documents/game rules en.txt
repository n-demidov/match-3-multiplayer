Game rules.

The goal of the game - is to capture as many fruits as possible.

Players start in opposite corners of the game board. Moves are made alternately. A timeout for a move is about 20 seconds.

You can grab only those fruits that adjoin yours.

If the captured fruit contacts other fruit(s) of the same kind, they also will be taken. Due to this, you can significantly increase the speed of conquest of the playing field.

Also, you can't capture a fruit if an opponent currently owns the same kind of the fruit. Using this feature, you could hamper your opponent.

Fruit's Bounty is an intellectual game with the addition of a randomness element.

At the end of a game, the winner is determined by the largest number of captured fruits.

A defeat can happen in three cases:
- A player missed 3 turns in a row.
- A player gave up.
- At the end of the game, a player collected less fruits than an opponent.

A draw can occur in those rare cases when both players have captured the same number of fruits.

The rating system is similar to the one used in chess. The calculation of scores depends on the difference in the ranking of both opponents: if a player defeats a stronger opponent, he/she will receive more points. In case a high rated player defeats the weaker one, he/she(the winner) will get an insignificant amount of rating (or nothing at all if the difference in rating is too big).

The rating table (on the main game window) shows the top rated players. The rating table takes into account the rating only starting from 600 points and it is updated every few seconds.
